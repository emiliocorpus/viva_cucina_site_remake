					<h2>The Chef's Table - A Private Dinner With The Chef</h2>
					<p><b>The Chef’s Table at Viva Cucina</b> is a new series of private dinners with San Ramon Valley’s premier local restaurant chefs, where customers watch while we prepare a four course meal, then sit down with us and enjoy the meal, wine and conversation together. Join us for our private chef dinners this year. Seating is limited, so make your reservations early. </p>

					The guests gave the evening rave reviews for the food, wine and the unique dining experience. The pictures above are of the classes we had last year, with Chef Shane, Chef Peter and Wine makers Phil and Debra Long, from Longevity Wines.
				</p>

				<p>
					We will be offering these classes again in the spring with a variety of chefs. The classes are usually on a Sunday from 6:00 to 9:00pm at Viva Cucina. The cost of these classes varies by menu, and reservations are required. We usually have a winery join us for a private tasting with the meal.
				</p>

				<u><b>Customers:</b> </u><br/>
				<p>This is a great opportunity for customers to learn from and eat dinner with these local chefs and wineries, in an informal private atmosphere. The winemakers will pour their specialty wines for us to taste, as well as pair the wines for the evening’s meal. We will also provide soft drinks and appetizers for these classes.</p>
				<u><b>Chefs: </b></u><br/>
				<p>Chefs are able to come together with their customers, in a private dinner setting, sharing with their customers how they prepare their dishes and the various techniques they use to create their food, while cooking in front of their customers. We reserve the right to change ingredients as needed.</p>
				<u><b>Reservations:</b></u><br/>
				<p>This is a private dinner and seating is limited. To hold your reservation you will need to pay for the dinner when making your reservations. Make checks payable to <b>Barbara Kelly</b>, then send or drop off your payment to the address above. If you need to cancel your reservation, call us no less than <b>five days</b> before the event date. Refunds will not be given for late cancellations.</p>
				<u><b>Future classes:</b></u><br/>
				<p>We will continue to sign up local chefs and wineries. For chefs and wineries that would like to participate in these classes, please call us. Check with us often to see when the next class will be or send us your email address and we will send you an invitation to the classes with the details!</p>
